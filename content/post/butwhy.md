title: But, Why?
---

#### Hi, I’m Alex. 

You might have just read a bit about me or perhaps we’re about to chat and you want to find out more about who I am. 

At this point, the most common question I get is, *“But, why?”*    

On paper, it is not obvious why having been a strategy consultant and software developer I am now researching dementia using multi-omics and data science and looking to use this experience to build products that improve the diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

The short answer is because we are our brains and dementia along with other neuropsychiatric disorders like depression present the greatest threats to the thing that makes us who we are.   

Globally, over 50 million people live with dementia(1) and over 250 million live with depression(2). Yet across these disorders treatment efficacy remains limited.
Like so many people, I’ve also witnessed the impact of these disorders first hand and I want to do my bit to help. Completing a part-time neuroscience masters where I could specialise in psychiatric genetics was a step towards that.

The longer answer is that multi-omics and data science combine the three things I’ve enjoyed most across my career; getting hands-on with technology, tackling complex problems with data and continuously learning. 

**Getting hands-on with technology** - I first learnt to code as an adult to build websites for my startup ideas but discovered instead that it was the coding itself that was most fun. Bioinformatics is bursting with technical innovation and I want to be writing code that contributes to this ecosystem.

**Tackling complex problems with data** - consulting is great when you have a well defined problem, lots of data to get stuck into and a well resourced team. Unfortunately, this is rare. I want to work in a data-rich environment where robust problem definition and data are fundamental to the product.

**Continuous learning** - underpinning all the things I’ve done in my career is a relentless desire to keep learning new stuff. Multi-omics, data science and neuroscience are rapidly growing fields packed full of super smart people who want to share their knowledge. 

So hopefully this helps answer *“why”*, but I’d love to talk more so if we aren’t already in contact please get in touch at alexander.handy@kcl.ac.uk.
