      <description>Hi, I’m Alex. You might have just read a bit about me or perhaps we’re about to chat and you want to find out more about who I am.
At this point, the most common question I get is, “But, why?”
On paper, it is not obvious why having been a strategy consultant and software developer I am now researching dementia using multi-omics and data science and looking to use this experience to build products that improve the diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.</description>
